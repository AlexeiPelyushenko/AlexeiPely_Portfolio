This program will randomly select one item from a designated list want-to-do.txt for you, and the idea is that that item is what you'll have to complete within 1 day.

You can change the list of choices in want-to-do.txt. Make sure to only edit lines below the dashed line.

(You can enter the same item multiple times if you'd like to alter the odds...)
